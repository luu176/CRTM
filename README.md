# Madrid Transport Card Reader (CRTM)  

This repository contains a script to read data from Madrid's public transport card (Consorcio Regional de Transportes de Madrid, CRTM). The script extracts and decodes relevant information such as card balance, travel history, and ticket details.  

### Features:  
- Reads data from a CRTM transport card using an NFC reader.  
- Decodes stored ticket information, balance, and recent travel history.  
- Outputs data in a human-readable format.  

### Requirements:  
- A compatible NFC reader (e.g., PN532, ACR122U, or Proxmark3).  
- Python with `nfcpy` or `pyscard` (depending on the reader).
